You know those cute or quirky little gifts you cram into the kids'
stockings?  That's what we're doing for December - an assortment
of small or odd programming languages that we wouldn't (or can't)
make a full meeting of, but put them together and they'll make
a fun grab bag.

*Help us stuff the stocking* - write
[the mailing list](http://d8ndl.org/#ml)
with your suggestion of a little language
you'd like to show us!  Plan to take no more than 15 minutes
(and less if you prefer); anybody can do that!

Commitments so far:

* [FORTH](https://www.forth.com/forth/) (Jordan Henderson)
* [Frink](https://frinklang.org/) (Catherine Devlin)
  - [Pint notebook](/meeting_notes/pint.ipynb)
