I have a grab bag of interesting goodies to show you for our Feb. 8 meeting.  I couldn't pull them into one theme, so let's go for two.

### Wild testing tools

- [Property-based testing](http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/property_based_testing) (all languages, but examples in [Hypothesis](http://hypothesis.works/))
- a look at [py.test](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/)

### Wild and wiggy code editors

- [Kite](https://kite.com/) - an "artificial pair programmer"
- [LightTable](http://lighttable.com/) - editor with live visualization
- [Leo](http://leoeditor.com/) - outlining-based editor

The bad thing about this is that it lacks a single theme.  The good thing is that *your* interesting goodies will fit right in.  So what have you seen lately that seemed interesting, useful, and/or dangerous?

We had an earlier plan to show data visualization tools, but it turns out 
that the pros are in town: the DDVG will have a 
[meetup](https://www.meetup.com/daytondv/events/228787605/) 
on data visualization tools with Python the very next day.
Consider signing up for that one, too!
