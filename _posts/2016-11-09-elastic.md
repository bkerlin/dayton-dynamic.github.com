Special presentation

Elasticsearch is an increasingly popular way to easily provide sophisticated 
searching and filtering of data, especially unstructured data.  More formally, 

> "Elasticsearch is a highly scalable open-source full-text search and analytics engine. It allows you to store, search, and analyze big volumes of data quickly and in near real time. It is generally used as the underlying engine/technology that powers applications that have complex search features and requirements."

Seph Coster will provide an introduction to Elasticsearch with a 
hands-on component.  Bring your laptops if available!
