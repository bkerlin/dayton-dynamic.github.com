**September 14: TOPIC CHANGE**

NOT Continuous Integration

See [Dayton Devops](https://www.meetup.com/Dayton-DevOps-Group/events/233739344/) for a Continuous Integration meeting.

**New Sep 14 topic: Zen of (Your Language Here)**

Have you heard of someone who "writes Java in Ruby" or
"writes COBOL in Python"? It's not a compliment.

Every language is more than just a set of syntax and rules;
it embodies a philosophy of communication and program structure,
and understanding that philosophy is important to making your
programs in that language the best and clearest they can be.

In Python, this concept has become known as the "Zen of Python".
But other languages have their own Zen.  We'll look at the Zen of
Python, Zen of Javascrip, and so on.
